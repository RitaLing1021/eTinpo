            <p>In 2023, eTINPO emerged as a rising star in Taiwan's thriving functional textile industry, responding to the balance between nature and technology.<br>
                Since 2022, the United States and the European Union have successfully proposed control laws for PFAS, with a comprehensive ban on the manufacture and sales of PFAS-containing textiles set to begin in 2025. As many manufacturers urgently seek solutions, eTINPO's emergence will become a sustainable pioneer in the waterproof and breathable membrane industry, allowing wearers to witness a new era of functionality and environmental protection.</p>
